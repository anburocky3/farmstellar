# Biochar Mastery Challenge Quest Images

This folder should contain images for the Biochar Mastery Challenge quest.

## Required Images:

### step1.jpg - Material Collection & Pit Preparation
- Collection of woody waste (twigs, branches, corn cobs)
- Digging the cone-shaped pit
- Tools required (shovel, matchbox, water bucket)
- Dry biomass ready for burning

### step2.jpg - The Initial Burn
- Starting the fire at the bottom of the pit
- Small fire established with dry twigs
- Smoke rising initially
- Safety precautions visible (water nearby)

### step3.jpg - Layering Process
- Adding layers of biomass gradually
- Fire burning evenly
- Covering the flames with new material
- "Quenching" the smoke with new layers

### step4.jpg - The Pyrolysis Phase
- Pit full of glowing embers
- No visible flames, just heat
- Covering the pit with soil or metal sheet
- Cutting off oxygen supply

### step5.jpg - Quenching & Crushing
- Pouring water/slurry on the hot char
- Steam rising (quenching)
- Crushing the cooled charcoal
- Final biochar texture (crumbly, black)

### step6.jpg - Activation & Application
- Mixing biochar with compost or cow dung slurry
- "Charging" the biochar
- Applying to soil/garden beds
- Incorporating into the root zone
