1. Farmers dont have good internet, it will run in just few kb data
2. Multi-Lingual - Based on the geography it will detect the local speaking languages and keep the default language. Also it loads appriopate font for example if user selects Hindi, it will load Devanagiri font from google, thus making this more UX friendly.

### Future Enchancements

1. Hiring other farmers for his task
2. Putting his land for lease.

### USP:

#### Smart and Real-time Practical Scoring

1 Contextual AI Verifications

- Feature: Gemini API doesn't just check the image; it verifies the action's sustainability impact. Example: Quest is "Start a compost pit." The farmer submits an image/short video. The AI verifies the presence of organic matter, size/scale relative to the farm, and geo-timestamp.
- WOW: Directly links user action to data-driven, quantifiable impact (KPI 2, KPI 3). It replaces manual extension agents, proving immediate scalability.

2. Sustainable Action Score (SAS)

- Feature: Each verified quest submission generates XP and a Sustainability Action Score (SAS). The SAS is visible on the dashboard and represents the farmer’s adoption rate of eco-friendly practices.
- WOW: This creates a new, measurable public metric for government policy success. It turns a behavioral change goal into a tangible, trackable number.

3. Incentive Linkage

- Feature: The SAS/XP is directly linked to eligibility points for government schemes (F3). High SAS = higher eligibility score for subsidies, low-interest credit, or training.
- WOW: The ultimate reward: It connects the digital game to real-world financial gain, providing a dynamic incentive system stronger than traditional programs (UVP).
